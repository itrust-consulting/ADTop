# ADTop (Attack-Defence Tree optimizer)

<!--- TODO: Add description as introduction, papers --->

## Dependencies

* Java JDK 8u92 or later
* Maven
* JavaFX/OpenJFX
* Scene Builder
* (Optionally) Any IDE, e.g. [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/ide/)

## Installation and execution

ADTop is built as a Maven project which makes it easier to install the tool.
Depending on users' preferences (command line or IDE), two paths can be taken to build the tool.

### Command-line based

After cloning or downloading the repository, execute ```mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true``` in the terminal
to build the project. (We use this argument to skip the tests that are currently in progress.)

Once all the tests have been implemented, simply using `mvn package` should successfully build it. The `package` goal of maven
also executes all the tests within the project.

### IDE based

Import the project in your favorite IDE and do a clean build. Following this, just do a direct `run` to execute it.

### Execution

If the build is successful, then the compiled `.jar` file can be found within the
`target` folder. Just execute the .jar file and ADTop is up and running.

For a Linux-based distribution, run the .jar file using the following command:

```
java -jar adtop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

## Development information

ADTop uses JavaFX which is required to create screens in FXML.

The class `GUI` does the indexing of the FXML file that is created via Scene builder.
This FXML file is connected to Index controller which contains other controllers.
FXML allows structuring as a nested application. The attributes of the FXML file
can be accessed using the `@FXML` tags.

The `Index` controller is the principal controller within the project with a principle attribute
called `Pack`. It contains all the models used in ADTop, measure containers, attack-defense trees, etc.

All the models used within the tool are in the `model class`.

The `Jackson` package is used to import/export `Measure` container(s).

`Apache POI` is used to import/export `Association Matrix` and `Apache XML` is used for parsing the XML.
_Note_: ADT is a bidirectional object which is the reason for a tree to be parsed manually.
